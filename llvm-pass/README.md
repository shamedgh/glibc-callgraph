# syscall-extract LLVM pass

Build:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Run:

```
opt -load syscall-extract/libSyscallExtractPass.so -syscall-extract [path-to-musllibc-bitcode] > /dev/null
```
This will generate a callgraph.out file with the extra edges, add this to the previously generated callgraph by SVF.

**NOTE** The callgraph generated by SVF is in SVG format you can use the `convertSvfCfgToHumanReadable.py` script to convert it the format used by Confine.
Then concat the callgraph.out generated by our pass to the callgraph generated by SVF.
