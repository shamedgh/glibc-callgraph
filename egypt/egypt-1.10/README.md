# Glibc CFG Generation

## Initial CFG
The initial CFG is generated by passing the RTL (glibc IR) files for all the 
glibc object files.
To create the RTL files we need to pass the following c flag the compiler:
```
make CFLAGS=-fdump-rtl-expand
```
Then we gather the full path to all RTL files using a simple find command:
```
find PATH_TO_BUILD/ -name "*.expand" > tmp
```
We finally run egypt on all the files:
```
./egypt `cat tmp` > initial.cfg
```
## Function to Syscall
The initial CFG can't extract calls to the system calls themselves, because 
many of the system call invocation code is created by macros and exist in 
the assembly files.
We extract those by parsing the make log (holds macros converted to syscall 
code) and the RTLs manually for calls to the system calls.
We use the following script for extracting the system calls which exist in 
the C code:
```
python parse_rtl_for_syscall.py sample.expand >> funcToSyscall.cfg
```
We use the next script for parsing the make log:
```
python parse_make_log.py path_to_log >> funcToSyscall.cfg
```
